Hotel Performance Analysis and Optimization
Summary:
The hospitality industry is highly competitive, with success depending on the effective management of bookings, room availability, customer satisfaction, and revenue. 
This business case outlines how the analysis of the provided datasets—dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, and fact_bookings—can be leveraged to gain insights into hotel performance, optimize operations, and improve profitability. 
The key objectives are to analyze booking trends, optimize room utilization, assess customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue realization.

I'm excited to share my latest analytical project, "Booking Revenue Optimization," leveraging multiple datasets to deliver actionable insights for the hospitality industry.
